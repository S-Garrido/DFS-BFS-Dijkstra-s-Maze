# Maze-Solver-Strategies
This is a collection of maze-solving algorithms that I made for my Object-Oriented Programming II class. Here, I created implementations of depth first search, breath first search, and Dijsktra's algorithm. The professor provided outline code and I would implement the following functions according to his specifications:

- MazeGraph.java
  - MazeGraph()
 - WeightedGraph.java
  - weightedGraph()
  - addObserver()
  - addVertex()
  - containsVertex()
  - addEdge()
  - getWeight()
  - DoBFS()
  - DoDFS()
  - DoDijsktra()
  -
